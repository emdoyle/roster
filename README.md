# Project Title: Web Application Development with Python

This project is a comprehensive, scalable solution for web application development using Python. It is designed with a modular approach and idiomatic Python code on the server-side.

## Project Components

The project is composed of three main components:

1. **Agents**: These are the server-side components that handle the business logic of the application. They interact with the database, process data, and communicate with other services.

2. **Workflows**: These are sequences of steps that define how the application responds to certain events or requests. They coordinate the agents and dictate the flow of data within the application.

3. **Teams**: These are groups of agents that work together to accomplish specific tasks. They allow for efficient division of work and collaboration among agents.

Each of these components plays a crucial role in the overall functionality and performance of the application.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into several main directories:

- `src`: This directory contains the source code for the agents and workflows. It is further divided into subdirectories for each agent and workflow.

- `tests`: This directory contains unit tests for the agents and workflows. It helps ensure the reliability and correctness of the code.

- `docs`: This directory contains documentation for the project, including this README file.

- `config`: This directory contains configuration files for the project. These files define settings for the application and its components.

## Setup and Running the Project

To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required Python packages using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the application: `python main.py`

Please refer to the documentation in the `docs` directory for more detailed instructions and information about the project.
